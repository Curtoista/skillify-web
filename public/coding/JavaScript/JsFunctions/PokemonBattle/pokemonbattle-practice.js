/*
  
  * In this challenge you will be writing a function to determine which pokemon will survive an attack from a super powerful pokemon !
    * You(Ash) and your friends Cilan and Iris are walking through the woods, when you suddenly see Dragonite, a hugely powerful pokemon.
    * The Dragonite unleashes its special mode on you, when suddenly a random pokemon pops out and attempts to protect you.
    * You will be given the number of 3 pointers and 2 pointers for the Raptors and Warriors and your job is to determine the winner
    * In Pokemon, a fire type will lose against a water type, but win against a grass type. When facing another fire type, no battle will occur as all fire types respect each other.
    * Dragonite is a fire type and depending on the type of pokemon that appears, Dragonite will either die, defeat you or, run away and refuse to attack if the other pokemon is a fire type.
    * Your challenge is to determine the outcome of the battle, depending on the type of pokemon that occurs.
    * You will either have to output "Win", "Loss", or "No Contest"
    * You may assume that in this case, the only 3 types of Pokemon are water, fire and grass.

  

  * Hints / Tips:
    
    
    
    * Conditional statements (if , else if, else) are helpful when needing to see if a specific criteria is met
